<h4>Overview</h4>
The Movie Recommendation System leverages machine learning techniques to suggest movies that users might enjoy. It analyzes various attributes of movies such as genres, cast, crew, and overviews to find similarities between movies and make recommendations. <br>
<h4>Features</h4>
<ul><li><b>Personalized Recommendations:</b> Get movie suggestions tailored to your tastes.</li></li>
<li><b>Content-Based Filtering:</b> Recommendations are based on the content of the movies.</li></ul>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<ul><li><b>Load the Dataset:</b>The notebook will guide you to load the movie dataset and display its structure.</li>
<li><b>Pre-process Data:</b>Follow the steps to clean and prepare the data for analysis.</li>
<li><b>Generate Recommendations:</b>Execute the cells to train the model and generate movie recommendations based on your input.</li></ul>
<h4>Dataset</h4>
The dataset used in this project includes comprehensive movie metadata such as titles, genres, cast, crew, and overviews. This data is essential for generating accurate and relevant recommendations.<br>
<h4>Methodology</h4>
<ul><li><b>TF-IDF Vectorization:</b>Converts textual movie descriptions into numerical vectors.</li>
<li><b>Cosine Similarity:</b>Measures the similarity between movie vectors to find movies that are alike.</li>
<li><b>Content-Based Filtering:</b>Recommends movies based on the similarity of their content to movies the user likes.</li></ul>
